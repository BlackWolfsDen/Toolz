another stupid lil tool by the mad scientist of Emudevs.com slp13at420

REMEMBER !! BACKUP !! BACKUP !! BACKUP !!
FOR testing and experimenting with creature levels above 75 for a better 255 experience.

this will produce an sql of entries for your creature class level stats for better boss's and custom mobs.
enter your spec's then grind the sql in . this does 1 class at a time. I recommend to start at level 85 or higher for your custom and allways backup  backup backup :D this will produce from level xxx to 255.
have fun testing :D
